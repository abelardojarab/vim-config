# How to contribute to neoterm

If you want to contribute you'll need to open a Pull Request.

Regardless if you're fixing a bug or adding a new feature we have a few rules
for your pull request

1. Add a good description to your pull request. If it's a bug, give examples of
   what's being fixed, what's the current behavior and the expected behavior. If
   its a feature describe what are the use cases for the feature, what's the
   user flow to use that. If possible add screenshots and/or gifs to enrich your
   description.
1. One feature/bugfix per pull request. Let's keep things simple, for you and
   for the reviewers. To make the pull request easier to review and easier to
   revert if needed, lets add **only** one feature/bugfix per pull request.
1. Add a [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/kassio/neoterm/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) entry, always.

And that's it! Thanks for contributing to neoterm, your help is appreciated!  ❤️💛💚💜💙🖤🧡
