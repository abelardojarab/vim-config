# move

It's annoying to delete and paste parts of a text just to move it up/down or
left/right a bit.
There is the `:m[ove]` command but it is quite awkward to use by todays
standards. vim-move is a Vim plugin that moves lines and selections in a more
visual manner. Out of the box, the following keys are mapped in visual and
normal mode:

    <A-k>   Move current line/selection up
    <A-j>   Move current line/selection down
    <A-h>   Move current character/selection left
    <A-l>   Move current character/selection right

The mappings can be prefixed with a count, e.g. `5<A-k>` will move the selection
up by 5 lines.

Features:

* vertical motions
* horizontal motions
* automatic indentation
* undo multiple moves with single `:undo`

See this short demo for a first impression:

## Installation

vim-move is compatible with all major plugin managers. To install it using
Vundle, add

```vim
Bundle 'matze/vim-move'
```

to your `.vimrc`.


## Customization

Use `g:move_key_modifier` to set a custom modifier for key bindings in normal mode. For
example,

```vim
let g:move_key_modifier = 'C'
```

which will create the following key bindings:

    <C-k>   Move current line/selections up
    <C-j>   Move current line/selections down

Use `g:move_key_modifier_visualmode` to set a custom modifier for key bindings in visual mode. For
example,

```vim
let g:move_key_modifier_visualmode = 'S'
```

which will create the following key bindings:

    <S-k>   Move currently selected block up
    <S-j>   Move currently selected block down


And so on...


*NOTE*

Both `g:move_key_modifier` and `g:move_key_modifier_visualmode` default to 'A'
for backwards compatibility with previous versions of vim-move.

If the default mappings do not work, see the `move_normal_option` option in the
help doc.
