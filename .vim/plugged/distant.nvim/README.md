# distant.nvim

[![CI](https://github.com/chipsenkbeil/distant.nvim/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/chipsenkbeil/distant.nvim/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A wrapper around [`distant`](https://github.com/chipsenkbeil/distant) that
enables users to edit remote files from the comfort of their local environment.

- **Requires neovim 0.5+**
- **Requires distant 0.15.x** (0.16+ not supported)

ðŸš§ **(Alpha stage software) This plugin is in rapid development and may
break or change frequently!** ðŸš§

## Features

Supports the following features against remote machines:

- [X] Retrieving a list of available files & directories
- [X] Editing remote files
- [X] Creating and deleting files & directories
- [X] Copying files & directories
- [X] Renaming files & directories
- [X] Running [LSPs](https://neovim.io/doc/lsp/) remotely and getting live results locally

Support is coming up for these features:

- [ ] Optional [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) integration

## Demo

### Intro Video

Demonstrates using distant.nvim to edit files and use a language server on a
remote machine.

### v0.1.0 Update

Demonstrates the new release of distant.nvim (v0.1.0) leveraging distant's new
lua module (v0.15.0). Main highlights include:

- integrated ssh authentication
- ssh mode
- refactored and simplified vim & Lua APIs
- complete help documentation

## Installation & Setup

Using [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim), the quickest
way to get up and running is the following:

```lua
use {
  'chipsenkbeil/distant.nvim',
  config = function()
    require('distant').setup {
      -- Applies Chip's personal settings to every machine you connect to
      --
      -- 1. Ensures that distant servers terminate with no connections
      -- 2. Provides navigation bindings for remote directories
      -- 3. Provides keybinding to jump into a remote file's parent directory
      ['*'] = require('distant.settings').chip_default()
    }
  end
}
```

The above will initialize the plugin with the following:

1. Any spawned distant server will shutdown after 60 seconds of inactivity
2. Standard keybindings are assigned for remote buffers (described below)

#### Within a file

| Key | Action                         |
|-----|--------------------------------|
| `-` | `lua distant.nav.actions.up()` |

#### Within a directory

| Key        | Action                              |
|------------|-------------------------------------|
| `<Return>` | `lua distant.nav.actions.edit()`    |
| `-`        | `lua distant.nav.actions.up()`      |
| `K`        | `lua distant.nav.actions.mkdir()`   |
| `N`        | `lua distant.nav.actions.newfile()` |
| `R`        | `lua distant.nav.actions.rename()`  |
| `D`        | `lua distant.nav.actions.remove()`  |

#### Post-setup

Run `:DistantInstall` to complete the setup.

## Getting Started

In order to operate against a remote machine, we first need to establish
a connection to it. To do this, we run `:DistantLaunch {host}` where the host
points to the remote machine and can be an IP address like `127.0.0.1` or
a domain like `example.com`.

The launch command will attempt to SSH into the remote machine using port 22
by default and start an instance of [`distant`](https://github.com/chipsenkbeil/distant).

Once started, all remote operations will be sent to that machine! You can try
out something simple like displaying a list of files, directories, and symlinks
by running `:DistantOpen /some/dir`, which will open a dialog that displays
all of the contents of the specified directory.
